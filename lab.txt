Write the tr2b.c and tr2u.c using getchar/putchar and read/write
respectively. To get tr2u, replace not only getchar and puthcar, but use &c in
the read and write functions.
Use the command tr -dc A-Za-z0-9 </dev/urandom | head -c 5000000 >randinput to
create a long enough text file to then input into the program using strace -o
strace_buf_output ./tr2b 'a' 'b' <randinput, strace -o strace_unbuf_output
./tr2u 'a' 'b' <randinput, strace -o strace_buf_output ./tr2b 'a' 'b' <randinput
> tr2boutput.txt, strace -o strace_unbuf_output ./tr2u 'a' 'b' <randinput >
tr2uoutput.txt.
Next, use time ./tr2b 'a' 'b' < randinput to get the time of the execution,
which is real 0m3.908s user 0m0.279s and sys 0m0.055s. time ./tr2u 'a' 'b' <
randinput gives us real 0m9.327s user 0m0.335s and sys 0m5.825s. We compare the
sys times (the times used by each program to ask for system calls) and find that
tr2b beats tr2u by more than 5 seconds.
