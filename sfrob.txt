Running ./randWords 1000 | time ./sfrobu takes 0.08 seconds and ./randWords 1000
| time ~/assn5/sfrob takes 0.01 seconds. ./randWords 1000 | time ./sfrobs takes
0 seconds. For 10000 words, sfrobu takes 0m0.073s, sfrob takes 0m0.002s, and
sfrobs takes 0m0.008s. For 1000000 words, sfrobu takes 0m6.582s, sfrob takes
0m0.023s,and sfrobs takes 0m0.109s. All time values are using the time for
sys calls, not the total time.
For 1000000 words, sfrobu had 18673297 (about 18000000) comparisons.
For 10000 words, sfrobu had 120515 (about 120000) comparisons. 
For 1000 words, sfrobu had 8707 (about 9000) comparisons.
With an input of 10^3, we had an output close to 10^3. For an input of 10^4, we
had an output of about 10^5. For an input of 10^6, we had an output of about
10^7. By this reasoning, we can assume that as the number of words grows at
least larger than 10^3, our number of comparisons will be approx. one order of
magnitude higher than our number of input words.
